          <p className="pb-5">
  Hi, I'm Abhijithâ€”most people call me Luttapi. I'm a Full Stack Developer with a focus on Python and Django on the backend, and React with Tailwind CSS on the frontend.
</p>

<p className="pb-5">
  My backend expertise includes Python, Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Git, and building RESTful APIs. 
</p>
<p className="pb-5">
  I also have experience working with cloud platforms like AWS and DigitalOcean, using services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, and API Gateway to deploy and scale applications efficiently.
</p>

<p className="pb-5">
  On the frontend, I work with React.js, Redux, Axios, Tailwind CSS, and Chakra UI.
</p>

<p className="pb-5">
  I started coding back in 2018 during school. In 11th grade, after getting my first PC, I began diving deeper into development. Instead of following the traditional college route, I chose self-learning. To sharpen both my technical and soft skills, I joined a bootcamp called Brocamp, which helped shape my journey in the IT field.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I have 7 months of hands-on industry experience working at Crisco Consulting as a Python Developer, where I contributed to building scalable backend systems and APIs.
